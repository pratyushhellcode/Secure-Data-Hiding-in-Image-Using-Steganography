# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## Introduction
Steganography is the practice of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret file or message to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. This technique can be used to hide data in various media such as text, audio, video, and images. In this context, we focus on image steganography, which involves embedding secret data within digital images.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a secure method for hiding data within an image using steganography. This involves:
- Implementing algorithms to embed secret data into an image.
- Ensuring the embedded data is imperceptible to the human eye.
- Providing methods to extract the hidden data securely.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Select the secret data to be hidden.
   - Choose a digital image to serve as the cover image.

2. **Data Embedding**: 
   - Convert the secret data into a binary format.
   - Embed the binary data into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel values in the cover image. This method is known as Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
   - Ensure the modification of pixel values is minimal to avoid noticeable changes in the cover image.

3. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Retrieve the LSBs from the stego image (image with hidden data).
   - Reconstruct the secret data from the retrieved bits.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement encryption techniques to secure the secret data before embedding it into the image.
   - Use a stego key to control the embedding process, ensuring that only authorized users can extract the hidden data.

## Applications
- **Secure Communication**: Transmitting confidential information without raising suspicion.
- **Digital Watermarking**: Embedding copyright information into digital media to protect intellectual property.
- **Data Integrity**: Hiding checksums or hash values within images to verify data integrity.

## Conclusion
Image steganography provides a robust method for secure data hiding, ensuring that secret information can be transmitted or stored without detection. By combining steganography with encryption, the security of the hidden data is enhanced, making it a valuable technique for various applications in secure communication and data protection.
